# cs5610-bslam-A1-Angular

My name is Brian Lam and I am a second semester graduate student at Northeastern. I completed the ALIGN program in August of 2018. I am a full time student so my experience is pretty limited but I am eager to learn. 

The purpose of this repo is for the Spring 2019 iteration of CS5610 (Web Development).
